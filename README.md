# Backend-Development-of-Ecommerce-Website
This repository consists of the back end code for an example e-commerce site. For the backend development I have used ExpressJs with Node as my server side language. 

## npm packages installed ##
Express
Express-Session
body-parser
ejs
pg

** Note that I haven't included a payment gateway, hence the proceed to checkout button in Cart.ejs is not functional **

## database

Database used: Postgres
host: localhost
port: 5432
user: postgres
password: create-your-own-password-here

Session-secret: Create your own  session secret

This is a very basic backend to an e-commerce site and will not be suitable for a fully-fledged e-commerce site.

Use this as a stepping stone, or as practice.
